# Source Server Manager

A small program I made for myself in Avalonia to perform some bulk operations on my TF2 servers.

## Features

- **Multi-Server Management** - Configure and manage multiple Source Engine servers from one interface (only TF2 tested)
- **RCON Commands** - Execute remote console commands on individual servers or in bulk
- **File Transfer** - Upload files/folders to servers via FTP or SFTP with automatic directory creation
- **Server Monitoring** - Real-time server status, player count, and current map tracking
- **Command History** - Keep track of previously executed RCON commands
- **Secure Storage** - Encrypted password storage for server credentials
- **Bulk Operations** - Execute commands and file uploads across multiple selected servers simultaneously
